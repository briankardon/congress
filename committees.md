# Committees

Names, IDs, contact info, and memberships of committees and subcommittees in the House and Senate.

All committee information is sourced from bulk data at [github.com/unitedstates](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators), which in turn comes from official [House](http://clerk.house.gov/committee_info/index.aspx) and [Senate](http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_assignments/assignments.htm) sources.

Feel free to [open a ticket](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/issues/new) with any bugs or suggestions.

We only provide information on current committees and memberships. For historic data on committee names, IDs, and contact info, refer to the [bulk data](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators).

## Methods

All requests require a valid [API key](index.html#parameters/api-key), and use the domain:

{% endhighlight %}

### /committees

**Committees and subcommittees a given legislator is assigned to**

{% highlight text %}

**All members of a particular committee**

{% highlight text %}
/committees?committee_id=SSAP&fields=members

You can turn off pagination for requests to `/committees`. Note that if the "per_page" operator is included, it must be the first operator in the query.
